# Structural tests for the github-runner service — install/lifecycle + isolation config.
#
# The properties held here are the ones whose failure is invisible until a live job runs
# on a hardened host: a token in argv, isolation that a workflow can opt out of, a
# cleanup hook that fails the job it was meant to tidy up after, or a version pin that
# a self-update quietly undoes.
#
# Run: bats platform/tests/test_service_github_runner.bats
