## Context

### Cross-signal identity and profile adoption baseline

The initial receiver contract uses the bounded `service` identity for metrics
and Loki, `service.name` for OTLP resources, and `service_name` for profiles.
`cluster` and `environment` come from controlled inventory values. Alert rules
add bounded `owner` and `severity` values. Request/user identifiers, trace IDs,
timestamps, raw paths, addresses, prompts, and secrets are not indexed metric
or Loki stream labels. Container and instance details remain for drill-down.

Service Overview lists metric-enabled services from Prometheus and queries Loki
by `service`; log-only coverage remains visible in the estate inventory and
Logs Drilldown. Missing telemetry remains a gap rather than a healthy default.
Profiling begins with one opt-in, measured Alloy self-profile target after its
resource and privacy gates pass. Add no other producer until measured ingestion,
retention, host headroom, and a successful profile receipt support the next wave.

See [proposal.md](proposal.md) for motivation and [the capability spec](specs/platform/estate-instrumentation/spec.md) for the behavior contract. The production receiver uses Prometheus for metrics, Loki for logs, and a private Alloy OTLP/gRPC path into single-node Tempo with local persistent storage (`platform/services/o11y/deployment/config/`, `compose.yml`). Grafana self-monitoring and agentgateway dashboards are provisioned. On 2026-09-28, a Dev-bound production deploy of reviewed commit `970dfa3ab545fa64f3c3829f99cf8ab29b7d32f2` passed live checks for all five stack components, the data sources, both dashboards, provisioned cross-signal link settings, alert rules, and the Discord contact point. Separate successful Semaphore receipts proved a named metrics target, a recent trace, alert delivery, retention, and cardinality; their IDs remain in private inventory. A user-visible trace-pivot click-through and some owning OpenSpec task checkboxes remain open. Production Alloy has no engine-socket mount, so its local container log/metrics discovery is not a production coverage receipt. These facts establish a receiver baseline, not estate-wide coverage; the broader rollout remains tracked by `observability-estate` and `inference-telemetry-production`. The architecture's old socket-scraped Prometheus and future Mimir sketches are not current collection mechanisms (`plan/architecture/06-observability-instrumentation.md`, as-built amendments).

The candidate set is generated from the current `platform/services/` and `agents/` trees at census time, including empty scaffolds. A directory is not proof of deployment: the first implementation phase must reconcile every candidate with private inventory, Semaphore templates, and live read-only discovery. The inventory also includes Proxmox, guest OS and container hosts, pfSense/network, DGX Spark, and external endpoints that Agent Cloud actually manages; scope is based on a declared managed target, not an indiscriminate network scan.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:** Reuse the receiver and onboarding verifier; give each deployed target an explicit signal contract; favor automatic runtime instrumentation; make cost, capacity, privacy, and recovery visible before increasing telemetry.

**Non-Goals:** Require traces from non-request infrastructure, claim traces from unsupported runtimes, switch to Mimir/object storage or high availability in this change, expose OTLP publicly, or clean-redeploy o11y and delete its current data. Future Kubernetes injection is a separate migration concern; the present estate uses Compose/Podman and VMs.

## Decisions

### 1. Inventory the actual estate before choosing exporters

Create one coverage declaration keyed by stable `service.name`/target identity, with lifecycle (`deployed`, `planned`, `retired`, `excluded`), owner, runtime/language, environment, host, signal applicability, method, expected endpoint, budget, and verification receipt. Generate an expected-target report from public service/agent definitions and private inventory; compare it with live read-only discovery, then resolve each discrepancy by a reviewed declaration. The public repo holds the schema and generic methods; `site-config` owns real hosts and network details. Extend the existing `Verify o11y Service` exact-target pattern instead of adding a separate verifier per service.

The audit enumerates every current service and agent directory at run time, including scaffolds, then adds managed infrastructure represented by deployment/inventory (Proxmox, guest OS/container runtimes, pfSense, DGX, and any supported edge dependencies). Every candidate gets an explicit lifecycle classification. This is a **candidate audit**, not a claim that all entries are running.

Alternative rejected: mark every repository directory covered. Several are scaffolds or retired; that would create false-green coverage.

### 2. Use the simplest supported signal source per target

Container stdout/stderr and journald/file logs go through a least-privilege, independently deployable host collector where central socket discovery cannot reach the host; the production receiver is the first such pilot because its engine socket is not mounted. Host collectors send OTLP logs and traces to receiver Alloy, which forwards them internally to Loki and Tempo. Native application/exporter `/metrics` is preferred over a second instrumentation library; two existing required opt-in labels (`scrape`, `port`) and optional `path`/`high_churn` labels serve co-located local containers, while remote targets use private inventory-rendered Prometheus scrape declarations. Do not expose Loki push or Prometheus remote-write as new external ingress. A process that serves HTTP/RPC requests gets a compatibility pilot for the current [OpenTelemetry zero-code mechanism](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/zero-code/) of its runtime, using deployment parameters rather than a source fork. Zero-code covers supported libraries, not the application's own domain operations; add a small explicit span only for a critical unobserved boundary. Default to no body/prompt/token capture, stable resource attributes, context propagation, bounded attribute values, and sampled traces. Do not inject unreviewed agents into privileged control-plane processes or require eBPF privileges across the fleet.

Signal selection per cohort:

| Cohort | Default collection | Trace decision |
|---|---|---|
| o11y, Caddy, DNS, step-ca, OpenBao, OPA, Authentik, Semaphore, NetBox | host/container logs; native or vetted exporter metrics; readiness | request-serving components only after runtime compatibility/security pilot |
| App and data services: n8n, Postiz, tududi, honcho, UhhCraft, ERPNext, OpenHands, Nextcloud/NocoDB/WikiJS if deployed | stdout plus DB/queue/app metrics; request/worker identity | runtime agent where supported, manual span for an important workflow gap |
| Agent and inference workloads: agentgateway, DGX, NemoClaw, NetClaw, WisBot, WebSmith, ComfyUI, Hunyuan3D | retain proven gateway/DGX paths; add worker/job and GPU/model metrics where supported | keep existing gateway trace path; pilot agent/runtime tracing with prompt redaction |
| Proxmox, guest OS, container engine, pfSense and other managed devices | node/hypervisor/device exporter or read-only API metrics, system logs, health | not applicable unless a request-serving software component has safe support |
| GitHub runner hosts | host health and bounded metrics first; job logs only after an entitlement and redaction decision | job tracing is not assumed |

Alternative rejected: mandate the same three signals for every process. A router or database can be fully diagnosable with logs and metrics while a fabricated trace requirement obscures missing real coverage.

### 3. Preserve one private receiver and bound every signal

Collectors use site-config source allowlists enforced by the reviewed host firewall; this is source-IP admission, not cryptographic host identity. OpenBao supplies any credentials through Ansible memory. Prometheus scrapes only declared private targets; OTLP ingress stays on a private interface behind source-scoped rules. Task 3.4 tests a rejected connection from a named, unapproved vantage host. Receiver Alloy gets explicit memory/backpressure handling and exporter retry/queue limits before more senders are added, following [Alloy's access and permission guidance](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/access_permissions/). Per-target scrape sample limits, allowed labels, log redaction/volume controls, trace head sampling, backend ingestion limits, and retention are declared and verified. Set a non-zero Prometheus size retention and receiver disk-free alert before the first expansion wave. Normalize the environment/cluster label from inventory in both Prometheus and Alloy before cross-environment joins; migrate existing dashboards and alerts with the label change. Alert on receiver refusal, collector drops, unhealthy scrape, missing logs, and absent expected traces. Correlate by normalized `service`/`service.name`, environment, and bounded instance identity; never put request IDs, user IDs, prompts, secrets, or raw URLs in metric labels.

Alternative rejected: allow every discovered host to export all telemetry. It expands network and cardinality risk before a service has a budget or owner.

### 4. Resize from evidence, not a guessed VM size

First deploy and verify a receiver-host node metric source through Semaphore; the current five-component scrapes do not provide VM CPU, memory, or filesystem capacity. This bounded source is the only sender allowed before the baseline. Start the representative seven-day clock at its first successful exact-target receipt, then measure peak log bytes/day, active and new Prometheus series, samples/s, Tempo spans/s and bytes/span, p95 host CPU/memory, guest disk use and growth by backend, Alloy drops/queue, and dashboard query pressure. Extend the window if traffic is unrepresentative. Pilot one workload in each cohort to estimate the next wave. Extend the existing production budget verifier and comparator for a read-only forecast rather than creating a parallel receipt path. Forecast retained bytes using measured ingestion and compression per backend multiplied by the declared retention, then add the pilot's peak factor and at least 30% free disk headroom. Require at least 25% memory headroom at observed peak and p95 CPU below 70%; a refusal/drop or unhealthy query is a stop even if the numeric margins pass. Record the forecast, assumptions, and receipt without private addresses in the public repo.

If the capacity gate fails, change `site-config` VM resource declarations and inventory together, review them, then run existing `platform/playbooks/resize-vm.yml` through its Dev-bound Semaphore template. That playbook grows only the Proxmox disk; before any disk resize, implement and check an idempotent Semaphore-managed guest partition/LV/filesystem growth path for the receiver's actual layout. Refuse unsupported layouts and require a backup/restore receipt. Its reboot remains opt-in; first read the current-vs-desired diff and confirm Proxmox storage, schedule any required reboot, then read back VM capacity, guest filesystem capacity, stack readiness, and preserved telemetry. A size increase is a measured gate, not a preselected number. Tempo's own [sizing guidance](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/set-up-for-tracing/setup-tempo/plan/size/) depends on span rate, span size, query rate, and retention; the same variables are recorded here.

Alternative rejected: immediately allocate a larger o11y VM. It could waste resources or still under-size the wrong bottleneck; retention and label cardinality must be measured first.

### 5. Deliver coverage in controlled cohorts

Complete the remaining o11y/agentgateway user-visible and owning-task receipts first. Build the coverage census and budget gate next. Pilot receiver-host metrics/log collection, then one other infrastructure VM and one application VM before expanding to control-plane/network, stateful applications, and agent/inference cohorts. For each remote target, probe from the receiver, apply the reviewed source-scoped firewall rule, prove HTTP 200 or OTLP admission, and only then merge its scrape/export declaration; an early `up=0` fires the existing service-down alert. Runner hosts stay a separate decision gate: their private-repository job output cannot enter shared Loki without an entitlement/redaction review, and their egress and OpenBao restrictions require a reviewed collector design. Each wave is a reviewed feature-to-`dev` change with one completed CodeRabbit or Claude review and green final-head CI, followed by Dev-bound Semaphore dry-run/check mode where meaningful, apply, exact-target proof, dashboards/alert drill, and an operator-driven reviewed revert/redeploy drill. Keep tightly related public changes in few PRs; private site-config declarations get their own reviewed PR because that repository owns production facts. Reconcile the coverage report after each wave; only a complete deployed-target inventory with fresh receipts closes this change.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Host collector permissions or remote logs expose sensitive data** → pilot least privilege; filter/redact before export; verify secrets and request bodies do not appear in Loki or task output.
- **Automatic agents alter process behavior or create high-cardinality telemetry** → compatibility matrix and one-service pilot per runtime; explicit version pin, startup/rollback switch, sampling and attribute limits.
- **Single-node local Tempo storage or receiver VM fills** → capacity gate, retention, disk alerts, no clean-volume validation; document backup/restore and separate storage migration if the measured load outgrows this topology.
- **A green `up` masks the wrong target** → exact instance and fresh log/trace checks; failed or stale receipts remain visible.
- **A VM resource change requires downtime** → keep reboot opt-in, verify guest filesystem and health after it, and pause the next wave until the previous baseline is restored.

## Migration Plan

1. Reconcile remaining receiver and agentgateway acceptance tasks with their live receipts; verify a user-visible trace pivot. Deploy a receiver-host node metric source and log collector, obtain an exact-target receipt, then begin the seven-day measurement window.
2. Add census declarations and extend the existing production budget verifier for read-only coverage/capacity reports; resolve all unclassified deployed targets. No other sender is enabled in this phase.
3. Pilot reusable host collection and runtime auto-instrumentation, then gate and release one cohort at a time. Add code-provisioned dashboards and alerts only for metrics and traces actually present.
4. When a wave needs capacity, merge the private resource declaration, converge it via Semaphore, run the reviewed guest-growth playbook if disk grew, verify preserved state, and rerun the budget forecast before enabling the wave.
5. On failure, an operator reverts the reviewed declaration through the branch workflow and redeploys from `dev`, verifies the old signal/alert baseline, and retains data. Disk growth is not rolled back by shrinking; unused capacity is left in place.

## Open Questions

- Which source-only service directories correspond to current production workloads? Resolve from private inventory and Semaphore/live readback in the census, then record lifecycle explicitly.
- What are the actual per-backend daily ingestion and compression factors? Measure after current acceptance; they determine the VM number but do not change this design.
